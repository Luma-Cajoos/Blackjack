                        The object of the game is to win money by creating card totals higher than those of the dealer's hand but not exceeding 21, or by stopping at a total in the hope that dealer will bust. On their turn, players choose to "hit" (take a card), "stand" (end their turn and stop without taking a card), "double" (double their wager, take a single card, and finish),"split" (if the two cards have the same value, separate them to make two hands), or "surrender" (give up a half-bet and retire from the game). Number cards count as their number, according to the player's choice. If the total exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it immediately lose.
